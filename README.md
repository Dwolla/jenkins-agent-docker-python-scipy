Docker image based on [Dwolla’s Python Jenkins Agent Docker image](https://github.com/Dwolla/jenkins-agent-docker-python) making Python scipy library available, as it requires system-level libraries and is somewhat large. SciPy is a commonly used library in scientific Python computing (e.g., analytics, ML). See https://www.scipy.org/about.html for more information.
